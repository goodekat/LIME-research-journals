Goals for spring semester:
- implement ideas for better binning methods
- find an idea that leads to better LIME explanations
- write firearm examiner's paper
- make plans for the statistical paper

Questions:
- Thanks for getting me on the CSAFE server!
- CSP money? (Can you email Marlene?)
- I heard back from JSM, and my abstract was accepted (likely as a speed presentation).
- GPSS conference? poster for machine learning colloquium?
- Can we go through what I did to clean the training data to make sure I did it right?
- Did Eric save the testing data so I can compare it to mine? (I wasn't able to find it?)
- Have you used seriate with nominal variables? (Is what I am doing okay?)
- Which version of slides do you like to use for presentations?

Completed:
- removed rows from training data so it matches with rtrees
- reran all of lime results with new training results
- fit logistic regression models and ran them through lime 
- kept working on seriation

Current Week:
- fix issue with seriation
- assess lime results on logistic regression models
- think about how to implement a simulation with a random forest

Later:
- look at 'removing the blindfold' for ideas
- read through Heike's new function
- think of a way to compute consistency across top two features
- compare the simple models based on different number of bins using an F-test
- look into literature on binning methods
- think about why R^2 would be better for some binning methods
- look into computing a diversity or consistency measure for the sensitivity analysis
- create distribution visualizations bins
- include a penalty for the number of parameters when choosing bins
- determine the best number of bins to use for each variable
- look at the AUC after binning
- write a draft of the examiners paper
- try out different weights
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
