TO DO LIST
-------------

Goals for spring semester:
- implement ideas for better binning methods
- find an idea that leads to better LIME explanations
- write firearm examiner's paper
- make plans for the statistical paper

Questions:
- my training predictions do not have the same length as the predictions from rtrees?
- should I do some simulations to better understand lime?
- drop = FALSE for gretchen albrecht?

Completed:
- add in all data cleaning steps to journal
- add rfscore to code where I create the training data
- transfer remaining work to multiple journals
- fix bug with sensativity analysis code

Current Week:
- write up paragraph of issues with LIME
- work on ordering tile plots and make sure they are correct
  - seriation: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/seriation/vignettes/seriation.pdf
- look into R2 bug

Later:
- read through Heike's new function
- think of a way to compute consistency across top two features
- compare the simple models based on different number of bins using an F-test
- look into literature on binning methods
- think about why R^2 would be better for some binning methods
- look into computing a diversity or consistency measure for the sensitivity analysis
- create distribution visualizations bins
- include a penalty for the number of parameters when choosing bins
- determine the best number of bins to use for each variable
- look at the AUC after binning
- write a draft of the examiners paper
- try out different weights
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
