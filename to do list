TO DO LIST
-------------

Goals for spring semester:
- implement ideas for better binning methods
- find an idea that leads to better LIME explanations
- write firearm examiner's paper
- make plans for the statistical paper

Questions:

Completed:
- finished reorganizing journal
- updated code in journal to account for tree based bins

Current:
- better understand trees and Heike's function to see if I can help
- think of a way to measure the consistency of variables chosen within in one implementation
- once Heike fixes the binning function:
  - update interpretations of best MSE and R^2
  - edit code for results from sensativity analysis to account for tree method
  - rerun all code in paper and journal
- look into submitting a JSM proposal

Later:
- write a draft of the examiners paper
- try out different weights
- look into computing a diversity measure for the sensitivity analysis
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- add distribution visualizations to the app with the chosen bins
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
