Talking points:
- questions
  - WSDS conference - do they offer funding? (for future years)
  - Should I adjust my JSM abstract to focus more on diagnostics for LIME?
- of interest
  - this book - https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/
  - poster presentation at GPSRC
- completed tasks
  - submitted application to IMSM workshop
  - registered for summer and fall credits
  - moved all papers to read cube

Current Week:
- obtain Papers (Thank you for submitting your request. A ReadCube Papers will review your request within 1 business day. If approved, you will receive your unique coupon code that will lock in your student rate of $36/year. If you have any question, drop us a note at: support@papersapp.com)
- look into bibText and add to paper
- work on paper
- finish journal on understanding lime
- change distance matrix in seriation to be 5-# of variables shared between two rows
  or try using distance matrix computed on the feature values
- fix issue with seriation
- try fitting LASSO logistic model and leave one out approach (for multicollinarity)
- assess lime results on logistic regression models
- think about how to implement a simulation with a random forest
- add in feature selection methods to LIME input options
- turn repetitive code into functions

Later:
- try retriculate to apply python version of lime
- look at 'removing the blindfold' for ideas
- read through Heike's new function
- think of a way to compute consistency across top two features
- compare the simple models based on different number of bins using an F-test
- look into literature on binning methods
- think about why R^2 would be better for some binning methods
- look into computing a diversity or consistency measure for the sensitivity analysis
- create distribution visualizations bins
- include a penalty for the number of parameters when choosing bins
- determine the best number of bins to use for each variable
- look at the AUC after binning
- write a draft of the examiners paper
- try out different weights
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me on sensativity analyses
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
