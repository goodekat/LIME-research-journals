TO DO LIST
-------------

Questions:
- can you sign my audit form?
- paper
  - how much detail should I spend describing the datasets? how familiar are the examiners 
    with the data? should I include plots of the feature distributions?
  - is it okay if I mention that the input bin options were chosen using a mse, or is that
    too much for the forensic examiners' paper?
  - how much of a literature review should I do? what papers should I include in the lit 
    review (other interpretation methods)? how indepth should I get with this paper?

Thoughts:

Completed:
- visualize and summarize the variation results
- choose an option that leads to both consistent and accurate results
  - I think that for this paper, it may be better to just focus on the result that 
    provides the most "accurate" result (think more about consistency later - even
    though the results do seem pretty consistent)
- created a journal and moved all experimenting code into the journal
- wrote up thoughts in journal

Current:
- outline paper and think of more questions for Heike
- make simple vs complicated app
- look into computing a diversity measure for the sensitivity analysis
- write a draft of the examiners paper (during break)
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression

Later:
- add distribution visualizations to the app with the chosen bins
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
