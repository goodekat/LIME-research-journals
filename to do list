TO DO LIST

Questions:
- What is samesource again?
- Plotting the "magnitudes"?
- Can we talk about the interpretation? I'm not sure that supports quite makes sense. It is more that
  if the variable increases, then the probability that TRUE occures increases.

Thoughts:
- It would be interesting to see the "magnitude" associated with a variable for a prediction, but
  this would require obtaining the scaled values of the perturbations.
- This seems much more meaningful to me than just the model coefficient associated with the variable.
- The current version shows which variables in the model have the largest coefficients.
- However, the importance of the variable might change depending on the observed value associated
  with the prediction of interest.
- I tried the individual plots, but I don't like it.

Completed:
- add in the if else statement to the paper
- join bullet and land into one line in the info section
- redo bullet levels
- set the x-axis scale to be the same for all feature plots (find the maximum)
- plot the bars in descending order
- add the RF probability and the decision to the feature plot description
- get rid of the upper triangle of the heatmap
- replaced NA with a more meaningful message in tooltip
- changed theme in heatmap which fixed the legend issue
- try creating the plot individually
- fix the curve number issue
- change the plot to show support in both directions

Current:
- change bins to lower, middle, and high and add a key
- email Carson about the dead space in the plot (make a toy example to show this)
- finish a draft of the introduction to the paper
- write a draft of the LIME overview section
- write about the training data and the random forest model from Hare
- figure out why the rf scores do not match the ones from LIME

Later:
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
