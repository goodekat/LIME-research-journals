Goals for spring semester:
- implement ideas for better binning methods
- find an idea that leads to better LIME explanations
- write firearm examiner's paper
- make plans for the statistical paper

Questions:
- Thanks for getting me on the CSAFE server! It it making my life so much easier!!
- Can we go through the data together to make sure I am using the correct data? Did Eric save the testing data somewhere?
- His paper discusses using 10,384 matches, but the rftrees model only has 8000ish comparisons?
- Where is his code for fitting the random forest? His GitHub is very confusing...

Completed:
- remove rows from training data so it matches with rtrees
- rerun all of lime results with new training restuls

Current Week:
- keep working on seriation (sort within rfscore)
- fit logistic regression model and run it through lime
- think about how to implement a simulation with a random forest
- look at 'removing the blindfold' for ideas

Later:
- read through Heike's new function
- think of a way to compute consistency across top two features
- compare the simple models based on different number of bins using an F-test
- look into literature on binning methods
- think about why R^2 would be better for some binning methods
- look into computing a diversity or consistency measure for the sensitivity analysis
- create distribution visualizations bins
- include a penalty for the number of parameters when choosing bins
- determine the best number of bins to use for each variable
- look at the AUC after binning
- write a draft of the examiners paper
- try out different weights
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
