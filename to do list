TO DO LIST
-------------

Questions:

Thoughts:
- I think I have realized that the 0-1 option is used for interpreting the coefficients.

Completed:
- add marks to heatmap on selected cell
- moved all data cleaning and reshaping code to paper from app
- subset the data to only create lime explanations on the necessary observations 
  - e.g. only kept one of the symmetric comparisons
- got response from Carson and dead space problem is now fixed
- figure out why the rf scores do not match the ones from LIME
- compare the LIME predictions to the RF predictions
- write paper section on LIME with all of the details of the algorithm
- add a key for the bins

Current:
- need to clean up the section on the description of LIME (better notation and explanation)
- add the section on the random forest as well to have a starting point for the notation
- try out different LIME default settings
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- look into what the original paper meant to be plotted
- finish a draft of the introduction to the paper
- write about the training data and the random forest model from Hare
- need to fix NA problem with selected cell mark

Later:
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
