TO DO LIST
-------------

Questions:
- Is it okay to spend the summer focuing on research?
- Is it possible for me to get access to the csafe server?
- How to handle the warnings that appear in between the switches?

Thoughts:

Completed:
- read paper on rfviz
- included setting bin_continuous to FALSE with use_density as both TRUE and FALSE
- updated app to include option for bin_continuous
- rerun code with only 2 to 6 bins
- try subsampling to deal with the binning issue

Current:
- add subsampling to app
- fix problem with app
- check on sampling variability (run each lime implementation several times)
- color bin text in the table
- read through LIME papers again
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- paper
  - ask Ganesh for his explanations of the features
  - need to clean up the section on the description of LIME (better notation and explanation)
  - add the section on the random forest as well to have a starting point for the notation
  - finish a draft of the introduction to the paper
  - write about the training data
  - make list of features and describe them
  - write definitions of what LIME outputs
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression

Later:
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
