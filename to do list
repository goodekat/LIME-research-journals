TO DO LIST
-------------

Questions:
- conference money?
- ask about ggResidpanel error: Error in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label),
  x$x, x$y, : polygon edge not found

Thoughts:

Completed:
- write more detailed description of the issues with current settings of lime
- make simple vs complicated app

Current:
- write a draft of the examiners paper (during break)
- try out different weights
- work with Heike's function to get the tree bins up and running
- look into computing a diversity measure for the sensitivity analysis
- read through LIME papers again

Later:
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- add distribution visualizations to the app with the chosen bins
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
