Talking points:
- WSDS conference - do they offer funding? (for future years)
- should I adjust my JSM abstract to focus more on diagnostics for LIME?

Current Week:
- email possible professors for POSC:
  - Sigurdur Olafsson olafsson@iastate.edu
  - Kris
  - Danica
  - Dixon
- look into bibText and add to paper
- obtain Papers and move all papers there
- work on paper
- finish journal on understanding lime
- change distance matrix in seriation to be 5-# of variables shared between two rows
  or try using distance matrix computed on the feature values
- fix issue with seriation
- try fitting LASSO logistic model and leave one out approach (for multicollinarity)
- assess lime results on logistic regression models
- think about how to implement a simulation with a random forest
- add in feature selection methods to LIME input options

Later:
- turn repetitive code into functions
- try retriculate to apply python version of lime
- look at 'removing the blindfold' for ideas
- read through Heike's new function
- think of a way to compute consistency across top two features
- compare the simple models based on different number of bins using an F-test
- look into literature on binning methods
- think about why R^2 would be better for some binning methods
- look into computing a diversity or consistency measure for the sensitivity analysis
- create distribution visualizations bins
- include a penalty for the number of parameters when choosing bins
- determine the best number of bins to use for each variable
- look at the AUC after binning
- write a draft of the examiners paper
- try out different weights
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me on sensativity analyses
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
