TO DO LIST
-------------

Goals for spring semester:
- implement ideas for better binning methods
- find an idea that leads to better LIME explanations
- write firearm examiner's paper
- make plans for the statistical paper

Questions:
- which type of presentation to do at JSM?

Completed:
- sorted by same source in the plots
- switch to using rfscore instead of samesource with the trees
- switch color scheme

Current:
- go through code, check for errors, and clean up
- write an abstract draft for JSM
- better understand trees and Heike's function
- look into using the seration package to bring things into a nice order in plots
- look into literature on binning methods
- think about why R^2 would be better for some binning methods
- look into computing a diversity or consistency measure for the sensitivity analysis
- create distribution visualizations bins

Later:
- write a draft of the examiners paper
- try out different weights
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
