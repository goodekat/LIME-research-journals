TO DO LIST
-------------

Goals for spring semester:
- implement ideas for better binning methods
- find an idea that leads to better LIME explanations
- write draft of firearm examiner's paper
- make plans for the statistical paper

Questions:

Completed:

Current:
- finish reorganizing journal
- update all code in journal to account for tree based bins
- rerun all code once Heike fixes the binning function
- run sensativity analysis with tree method included
- visualize results of sensativity analysis

Later:
- submit a JSM proposal
- write a draft of the examiners paper
- try out different weights
- look into computing a diversity measure for the sensitivity analysis
- read through LIME papers again
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- add distribution visualizations to the app with the chosen bins
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
