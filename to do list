TO DO LIST
-------------

Questions:
- ask about CSP

Thoughts:

Completed:
- look at "residual" plots

Current:
- first steps to try to improve LIME:
  - try more bins
  - try changing quantile_bins to FALSE
  - try setting bin_continuous to FALSE with use_density as both TRUE and FALSE
- run lime implementations
- compute summary statistics and plot the results from the lime implementations
- switch app to the best option
- color bin text in the table
- read through LIME papers again
- next steps to try to improve LIME: 
  - create a table comparing the MSEs
  - try subsampling to deal with the binning issue
  - try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- paper
  - ask Ganesh for his explanations of the features
  - need to clean up the section on the description of LIME (better notation and explanation)
  - add the section on the random forest as well to have a starting point for the notation
  - finish a draft of the introduction to the paper
  - write about the training data
  - make list of features and describe them
  - write definitions of what LIME outputs
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression

Later:
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
