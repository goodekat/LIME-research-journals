Questions:
- how to name bins?
- how to handle the issue of creating my own bins?
- is it okay if I store my functions in the code folder?

Thoughts:

Completed:
- plot distributions of features colored by samesource with the training data
- created correlation heatmaps of the features
- need to fix NA problem with selected cell mark
- update table print to approriate lower and upper bounds
- generalize function for creating the bin table
- generalize function for creating the bin label
- fix bin names in app

Current:
- compare RF to caret
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
- look into what the original paper meant to be plotted
- try to improve LIME results:
  - try subsampling to deal with the binning issue
  - try more bins
  - try changing quantile_bins to FALSE
  - try setting bin_continuous to FALSE and use_density to TRUE
  - could try making ccf a categorical variable (probably won't work since not in training)
  - try out logistic regression idea
- paper
  - ask Ganesh for his explanations of the features
  - need to clean up the section on the description of LIME (better notation and explanation)
  - add the section on the random forest as well to have a starting point for the notation
  - finish a draft of the introduction to the paper
  - write about the training data
  - make list of features and describe them
  - write definitions of what LIME outputs


Later:
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
