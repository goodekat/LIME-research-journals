TO DO LIST

Questions:
- What other measures should be used to assess the consistency of the results?
- I switched to using renderTable for the bin table, but I can't figure out how to color 
  the table. Do you know how to do this? (without getting into DT)
- I've been starting to think about how to make the app look more "professional". For 
  example, I'd like to include some text paragraphs explaning how to use the app. Do you 
  have any thoughts on this matter?

Thoughts:
- I would like to use the full training dataset for the firearm examiners' paper. Then for the
  statistical paper, we can get into trying out other ways to choose the bins.
- I think we should use equally spaced bins for both set 1 and set 11, but we should use 
  3 bins for set 1 and 2 bins for set 11. These are the options with the lowest MSEs that
  use bins. (This thought was made before seeing the full variation in MSEs)

Completed:
- changed lime results back to not including subsampling
- look into "future" and "furrr" packages that are good for improving computation speed
- clean up app code
- fix problem with app due to bins with the non-bin cases
- fix issue with 4 quantile bins
- choose a model that is good - not necessarily the best (see thoughts above)
- look into a conditional panel in Shiny and made reactive panels conditional panels
- deal with the warnings that appear in between the switches in app
  - put in a check for a dataset then proceed or do nothing
  - by switching to the conditional selectors, it changed this option
- tried to color bin text in the table
- played around with a theme

Current:
- check on sampling variability (run each lime implementation several times)
- think about the fact that we want to choose an option that leads to consistent results
- clean up the section on the description of LIME (better notation and explanation)
- make simple vs complicated app
- read through LIME papers again
- paper
  - ask Ganesh for his explanations of the features
  - make list of features and describe them
  - add the section on the random forest as well to have a starting point for the notation
  - finish a draft of the introduction to the paper
  - write about the training data
- compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression

Later:
- add distribution visualizations to the app with the chosen bins
- try out logistic regression idea for bins (write own bin list to put in explain)
- try out subsampling idea
- read new paper on Anchor
- read book Dr. Dixon lent me
- try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
