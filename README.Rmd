# LIME Research <img align="right" height="200" src="./figures/lime.png">

Repository for research projects on LIME applied to the Hamby bullet data.

## Talking points

- Paper
    - I reorganized my work into three repos and consolidated the journals
    - Can you re-explain your vision with the minipage format?
    - Sometimes LIME doesn't work on my computer anymore...
    - Explain the details of the locality paper to Heike (ask about the radius definition)
    - Should I make the LIME procedure more general?
- Internship
    - Dixon said he is fine with me switching to 10 hours in the spring (as long as Dr. Caragea agrees)
    - See list of activites for Fall 2019
- Graphics Group
    - show updated schedule
    - email list (should I be added as an admin?)
    - Susan's idea (could we ask Joe, Erin, and/or Charlotte if they would be interested in preparing this talk?)
    - How to include an image in the preview of a post in blogdown?
    - Are you still available to talk next week?
    - Cookies for tomorrow?

## To Do List

*First draft of paper due two weeks into the semester (Tuesday, September 10)*

**Current**

- go back through LIME procedure and update with new understanding (such as d' can be larger than d)
- add an assert_that statement in the code to check if the LIME package is changing
- point out differences and similarities from the other paper (such as normal sampling)
- code up Laugel et al's work
- read through papers giving an overview of the current explanation methods

**Later**

- LIME diagnostics  
    - turn repetitive code into functions
    - try out different weights
    - change distance matrix in seriation to be 5-# of variables shared between two rows
    - try using distance matrix computed on the feature value with seriation
    - add in feature selection methods to LIME input options
    - think of a way to compute consistency across top two features
    - Siggi suggests refitting the RF model to the perturbations and then continuing with LIME with the RF predictions from the new model - this may help to understand if the problems are due to the sampling procedure or LIME itself
    - he also suggested looking into SMOTE for dealing the imbalance in the classes with sampling
    - compare the simple models based on different number of bins using an F-test
    - look into computing a diversity or consistency measure for the sensitivity analysis
    - include a penalty for the number of parameters when choosing bins
    - look at the AUC after binning
    - compute a likelihood ratio prob TRUE / prob FALSE from the LIME ridge regression
    - try visualizing the features from the test data using dimension reduction and
  coloring them by variables suggested to be important by lime
- explainer models
    - look into iml (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jP6Rg13PEkQ)
    - look more into Molnar and his adviser Bernd
    - look into [MAPLE](https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2019/07/13/towards-interpretable-tree-ensembles/)
- understanding LIME
    - read through LIME papers again
    - finish journal on understanding lime (look at the RF in the local region lime is considering to see if it agrees with the lime explanations)
    - try fitting LASSO logistic model and leave one out approach (for multicollinarity)
    - assess lime results on logistic regression models
    - think about how the argmin is accomplished by the LIME R package
    - try retriculate to apply python version of lime
    - look into literature on binning methods
    - think about why R^2 would be better for some binning methods
    - read new paper on Anchor
- simulation with RF
    - think about how to implement a simulation with a random forest
    - look back at 601 notes from Kaiser for model assessment
    - look at Hadley's 'removing the blindfold' for ideas
    - read book Dr. Dixon lent me on sensitivity analyses
- possible improvements to LIME
    - determine the best number of bins to use for each variable
    - try out subsampling idea
- random forests confidence intervals
    - look into papers by Giles Hooker and Lucas Mentch
    - Dr. Nettleton paper

## Contents

Descriptions of the materials in this repository are listed below.

**code**

This folder is a place for storing code that is used throughout the project:

- `app.R`: code for the Shiny app for visualizing the LIME explanations associated with the bullet land comparisons
- `helper_functions.R`: R script with functions that I use in the journals and will probably end up using in the papers as well
  
**figures**

This folder contains static images:

- `lime.png`: fun picture of a lime to use in the readme
- `python-ridge1`, `python-ridge2`, and `python-ridge3`: screen shots of the python LIME package showing the use of a ridge regression as the explainer
