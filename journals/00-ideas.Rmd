# Concerns with LIME

- We think that the model explainer needs to be close enough to the complex model that it is trying to explain in order to do a good job of providing explanations. For example, the binned regression works okay with neural networks, but it does not work well with a random forest. Maybe a tree explainer or a logistic regression explainer would work better with a random forest.

# Ideas to Try

- Could try fitting a regression with interactions and see if LIME does a good job of explaining the model.

# General Thoughts about LIME

- LIME is kind of like a jacknife technique

# Current Plan

- Write a paper that shows that LIME does not work well with random forests.
